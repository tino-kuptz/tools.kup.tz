        "intro": "This website serves as a central hub for a collection of tools that I have developed over time. It was created to bundle my projects and ideas in one place and make them accessible.",
        "development": "The content of this page is continuously expanded and updated, with a focus on providing useful solutions. However, it may happen that the page appears incomplete or empty at times – this is a natural part of the development process, as I only program appropriate tools when I need them.",

        "title": "About Tokens",
        "intro": "This website uses tokens to control the use of various tools. Tokens are a type of virtual credit that is available to you to use the site's features. Some tools that require server-side processing consume tokens. This helps control server load and ensure that the site is not overloaded.",
        "abuse": "The tokens are also intended to prevent abuse. After all, I am the operator of this site and therefore also the recipient of the bill from Cloudflare.",
        "generation": "There is no way to buy or increase tokens. Tokens are automatically generated and are the same for every user. Tokens are valid per IP subnet, so you receive your tokens per internet connection, not per device. This also means that you can share tokens with other users who are on the same subnet. For this reason, I don't show anywhere how the tokens of a subnet are consumed.",
        "reset": "Tokens reset daily at 00:00 UTC. This means that you have a new amount of tokens available every day to use the tools. If you have used up your tokens, you can simply wait until the next day begins to regain access to the features.",
        "opensource": "This site is open source. If you ever need more tokens than you get per day, you can also host it yourself and adjust the token limits. The source code is available on GitHub.",
